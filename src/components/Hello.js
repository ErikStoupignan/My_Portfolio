          Hello! My name is Erik, a Full-Stack Software Developer who graduated from Microverse;
          an online training school that uses pair programming and real-world projects to teach
          development, where I have built several websites and applications, both collaboratively
          and independently, while learning HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React/Redux, Ruby, and Ruby on
          Rails. Do not hesitate to contact me if you are willing to collaborate or need your
          application coded.
